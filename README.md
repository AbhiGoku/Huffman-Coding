# Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding - In this I have build a coding and decoding text file.

2 ways of excuting this code.

**#1. through the Windows GUI.**
  User has to run the compress.bat to run the Compress.java to get the compressed file. In the step 2, user has to run Decompress.bat to get back the test.txt in output.txt decompress format.

**#2. through terminal/ command line prompt**
  User has to run the makefile through the cmd line prompt. Open the cmd in the code existing file and run "make". the files will be executed and to get the output.txt file.
